### Search Implementation
The search functionality allows users to find movies by title, year, director, and star's name.
- Supports substring matching for `title`, `director`, and `star` fields using `LIKE` predicate.
- Example: `SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE '%Term%'` returns movies with "Terminator" and "Terminal".
- Year only supports exact matches.
